# Multiplayer System

Multiplayer System controls all in-game user to user interactions happening in real-time. Due to the difficulty of world building and world scaling, and some other features, our development team adjusted the engine used for the core system management to satisfy the essential tasks.

Hub Instancing is used for adjusting purposes. On account of server hardware restrictions, users are placed into game instances, minimizing overall load and increasing networking execution. This system is often used in online games, with a high amount of concurrent online players.
