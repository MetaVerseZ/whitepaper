# Construction Design

The Meta-Z ecosystem is a set that consists of services connected via the internet. An in-game Marketplace, a Metaverse gaming platform and a bunch of smart contracts.

### 2.1 In-game Marketplace Platform (currently under development)

Meta-z marketplace is a frontend application written in Next.js using TypeScript. The Backend of the marketplace is written in TypeScript and Express.js. The Marketplace system account is also used by the game, which concludes that you have one account for buying items then travelling over the virtual world of the metaverse.

### 2.2 Metaverse Gaming Platform (currently under development)

The Meta-Z project is mainly developed in the shape of a multiplayer game with an administratively generated world. The game is built on the Unity Engine, with a couple of third party game assets all purchased/acquired by the Meta-Z.
