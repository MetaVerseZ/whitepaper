# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’¼ Meta-Z project

## Whats is meta-Z project ?&#x20;

The foundation stone for **meta-Z** has been laid in **December 2021,** by its founder _Younes Kasdi_, with the help of _Joseph grey_ and _Nadhir Ferdji_. **Meta-Z** project is a metaverse **game and marketplace** which was built on the Unity engine based on the following concepts: Metaverse world, social multiplayer and play to earn game.

**Meta-Z** started as a game prototype for the metaverse, which had a basic concept of allowing players to make their own unique stuff using "**`NFT`**" technology and share it with each others, which then branched out into 4 primary building blocks, **the base game, the builder, the marketplace and Meta-Z token** used on the marketplace.
