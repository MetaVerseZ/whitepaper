### Game design:



### 3.1 Unity Engine

Unity version 2020.3 LTS is used for game development as the game engine. It features a great developer community, a modern technological store, a quick game creation approach with low-level enough programming proficiency for our advanced needs, and multi-platform support.

From the network interaction point of view, The Unity Engine restrains numerous built-in data transporting tools with all the required techniques for our team, including frequently used Rest API. All the user transported data is safely encrypted and information is secured.

Adjusting our game for desktop platforms, our team had a wider range of technological solutions. This comprises several graphics rendering and blockchain computation advantages which improves player experience.

### 3.2 Multiplayer System

Multiplayer System controls all in-game user to user interactions happening in realtime. Due to the difficulty of world building and world scaling, and some other features, our development team adjusted the engine used for the core system managment to satisfy the essential tasks.

Hub Instancing is used for adjusting purposes. On account of server hardware restrictions, users are placed into game instances, minimizing overall load and increasing networking execution. This system is often used in online games, with a high amount of concurrent online players.



### 1.3 Play-to-earn system

We expect a lot of world wide players to invest their time playing the game As so we plan on giving the players a kind of reward for their time spent in meta-z world.

Our earning system is based on giving a daily share prize of Meta-Z token, to be collected by players in the Meta-z world following their efforts and spent time on the game.
