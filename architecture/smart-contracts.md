# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are implemented in the **Solidity** language. Until now, the project has **Meta Z Token** cryptocurrency protocol based on the **BEP-20** standard, **Meta Z Item** digital ownership protocol based on the **ERC-1155** standard, and **Meta Z Market** smart contract that manages listing, buying and selling **Meta Z Items**.

* **Solidity** is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart **contracts**.
* **Smart contracts** are programs which govern the behavior of accounts within the blockchain state.

Our smart contracts are hosted on **Binance Smart Chain.**
